            Hello there! My name is Lovro, and I&apos;m a freelance designer. I
            work directly with clients to provide high-quality design solutions
            that help businesses achieve their goals.
          </p>
          <p className={paragraphStyles}>
            I work directly with you on a one-to-one basis. This approach
            ensures that I can dedicate my full attention to your project,
            delivering the highest quality design solutions tailored to your
            needs.
          </p>
          <p className={paragraphStyles}>
            My approach is simple: instead of charging per project or per hour,
            I offer a flat monthly rate that covers as many design requests as
            you need.
          </p>
          <p className={paragraphStyles}>
            This way, you can focus on your business without worrying about the
            cost of design work.
          </p>
          <div className="my-4 border-l-2 border-white pl-4">
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold">
              My ultimate goal is your success. Iâ€™am committed to working with
              you until you&apos;re completely satisfied.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p className={paragraphStyles}>
            If you&apos;re interested in learning more about my approach and how
            I can help grow your business,{" "}
